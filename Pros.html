<h1>Pros of Remote Work</h1>
<p>Many people say that they would want to work from home. Forbes.com says that 98% of people want to work from home at least sometimes. TechTarget.com gives a lot of reasons as to why people want to work from home. One of the reasons it gives is a better work life balance. Remote work provides a better balance because you spend less time getting ready for work and commuting to work. That half an hour to potentially two hours could be used for sleep or other personal things. Forbes also backs this up, saying “71% of remote workers said remote work helps balance their work and personal life”. Another point the site brings up is timeliness and reduced absences. It's very hard to be late for work when it's in the next room from you. When you have to drive thirty minutes to work, it adds a lot of variability to your schedule. The potential road work, accidents, and car problems make it so people are more often late to work. Remote work can save money for both the company and the workers, according to TechTarget. Workers don’t have to pay for gas to commute to work, and companies don’t have to pay for things like office buildings and utilities. Another thing the site says is good about remote work is flexibility. Working more flexible hours allow people to set their own schedule, which is “invaluable” to both the company and the employee. Because of all of these, there is a product of high productivity. It’s easier to be productive when you are overall happier. And it is easier to be happy when you can enjoy work more, work when you want, and have more time to do things you want rather than working. </p>
