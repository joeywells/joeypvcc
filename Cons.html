<h1>Cons of Remote Work</h1>
<p>While working from home sounds like an amazing idea, there are some drawbacks of it. Forbes.com says that “69% of remote workers report increased burnout from digital communication tools”. The consistent flow of digital communication produces fatigue and reduces work and life boundaries. It also says that 53% of people who work from home find it harder to relate to their coworkers. Relationships between coworkers are quite important in the workplace as it boosts productivity and cooperation, and it is hard to build relationships purely over a digital landscape. TechTarget.com states that distractions from home are also a large problem. It is easy to get distracted by children, pets, or other non-work related tasks when you’re at home, even when you’re supposed to be working. Isolation is another issue Techtarget brings up. Isolation in work from home environments is very prevalent, because you don’t have to leave your house or socialize nearly as much as working in person. This really hurts both the employee and the company, because mental health goes down and productivity follows. Also, remote work proposes cybersecurity concerns. When someone with access to private medical documents or other sensitive info works from home, they are at a greater risk of having information stolen. Having one secure network would be much safer than having the information spread across so many different I.P.s and network pathways. While working from home does have its benefits, there are many problems that can arise with it and run a risk to great to take in some situations.  </p>
